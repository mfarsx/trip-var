# Testing the CI/CD Pipeline

## What Just Happened

A test commit was pushed to trigger the CI/CD workflows. Here's what to monitor:

## Workflows Running Now

### 1. Test Suite (`test.yml`)
**Status:** üü° Running  
**What it does:**
- Tests server (Jest tests)
- Tests client (Vitest tests + build)

**Expected Duration:** 2-5 minutes

### 2. Security Scan (`security.yml`)
**Status:** üü° Running  
**What it does:**
- Audits server dependencies (`npm audit`)
- Audits client dependencies (`npm audit`)

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 minutes

### 3. Build Images (`build.yml`)
**Status:** üü° Running  
**What it does:**
- Builds server Docker image
- Builds client Docker image
- Pushes to GitHub Container Registry

**Expected Duration:** 3-7 minutes

## How to Monitor

### Option 1: GitHub Web UI
Visit: **https://github.com/mfarsx/trip-var/actions**

You'll see:
- Real-time logs for each workflow
- Status indicators (üü° Running, ‚úÖ Passed, ‚ùå Failed)
- Detailed output for each step

### Option 2: CLI Monitoring
```bash
# Watch for workflow completion
gh run watch

# List recent runs
gh run list

# View logs for a specific run
gh run view
```

### Option 3: Check Repository Badges
The README.md badges will update automatically:
- Test status badge
- Build status badge
- Security status badge

## What Success Looks Like

### ‚úÖ All Tests Pass
- Server tests: All assertions pass
- Client tests: All assertions pass
- Build: Client builds successfully

### ‚úÖ Security Scan Complete
- No critical vulnerabilities (or warnings acceptable)
- Audit completes without blocking

### ‚úÖ Images Built and Pushed
- Server image: `ghcr.io/mfarsx/trip-var-server:latest`
- Client image: `ghcr.io/mfarsx/trip-var-client:latest`
- Both images tagged with commit SHA

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Workflows Complete
Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/mfarsx/trip-var/actions

### 2. Check Test Results
Look for:
- `test.yml` shows ‚úÖ or ‚ùå
- View detailed logs if tests fail
- Check which tests failed (server or client)

### 3. Check Security Scan
- Warnings are OK
- Critical vulnerabilities should be addressed
- Non-blocking by design

### 4. Verify Images
```bash
# Check if images exist in GHCR
docker pull ghcr.io/mfarsx/trip-var-server:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/mfarsx/trip-var-client:latest
```

### 5. Optional: Test Deployment
To test deployment:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Click "Deploy" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select environment (production/staging)
5. Verify deployment succeeds

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail
1. Click on the failed workflow in GitHub Actions
2. Expand the failed step
3. Check the logs for error messages
4. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Test files not found
   - Environment misconfiguration

### If Build Fails
1. Check Dockerfile syntax
2. Verify Docker Hub access
3. Check build logs for specific errors

### If Nothing Runs
- Check branch protection rules
- Verify workflow file permissions
- Ensure `.github/workflows/` directory exists

## Expected Timelines

- **Immediate:** Workflows appear in Actions tab
- **1-2 min:** Security scan completes
- **2-5 min:** Tests complete
- **3-7 min:** Build completes
- **Total:** ~5-10 minutes for full pipeline

## Success Checklist

- [ ] All workflows appear in Actions tab
- [ ] Tests complete successfully
- [ ] Security scan completes without blocking
- [ ] Images pushed to GHCR
- [ ] Badges update in README
- [ ] No failed workflows

## After Success

Once workflows complete successfully:

1. **Pipeline is verified** ‚úÖ
2. **Ready for production use** ‚úÖ
3. **Automated on every push** ‚úÖ
4. **Docker images available** ‚úÖ

You can now:
- Merge PRs (will trigger tests)
- Deploy manually via Actions
- Push to main (auto-builds images)
