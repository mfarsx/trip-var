# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Summary

> **Last Updated**: Initial CI/CD setup - All workflows configured and ready for testing

## What Was Fixed

The CI/CD pipeline has been audited and improved to ensure it works at a basic level. Here's what was updated:

### 1. **Build Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
**Changes:**
- Added proper image tagging with commit SHA, branch name, and latest tags
- Added production target specification
- Improved caching strategy for faster builds
- Images are now properly versioned and stored in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

**Before:** Basic build without proper versioning
**After:** Properly tagged images with SHA, branch, and latest tags

### 2. **Deploy Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
**Changes:**
- Now pulls pre-built images from GHCR instead of building on server
- Proper environment variable handling via SSH
- Uses new `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` for production deployments
- Improved error handling with `set -e`

**Before:** Deployed by building images on the server
**After:** Deploys using pre-built images from GHCR registry

### 3. **Created New Files**
- `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`: Production compose file that pulls images from GHCR
- `.github/workflows/README.md`: Comprehensive documentation of all workflows

### 4. **Workflow Dependencies**
All workflows now support being called by other workflows:
- `test.yml`: Runs on push, PR, or when called
- `security.yml`: Runs on push, PR, schedule, or when called
- `pr-checks.yml`: Runs on PR events or when called

## How the Pipeline Works

### On Push to Main:
1. **test.yml** runs tests (server and client in parallel)
2. **security.yml** audits dependencies for vulnerabilities
3. **build.yml** builds Docker images and pushes to GHCR

### On Pull Request:
1. **test.yml** runs tests
2. **security.yml** audits dependencies
3. **pr-checks.yml** validates PR quality (title format, size)

### Manual Deployment:
1. Admin triggers **deploy.yml**
2. Selects environment (production/staging)
3. Pulls latest images from GHCR
4. Deploys containers
5. Runs health check

## Testing the Pipeline

### To test locally:
1. Make a small change to the repository
2. Commit and push to main
3. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs:
   - ✅ Tests should pass
   - ✅ Security scan should complete
   - ✅ Images should be built and pushed to GHCR

### To test deployment:
1. Go to GitHub Actions → Deploy workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select environment (production/staging)
4. Monitor the deployment logs

## Required Secrets

Before deploying, ensure these secrets are configured in GitHub:
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `SSH_USER`
- `SERVER_HOST`

## Image Registry

Images are stored at:
- Server: `ghcr.io/<your-org>/<repo>-server`
- Client: `ghcr.io/<your-org>/<repo>-client`

Tags available:
- `latest`: Most recent build from main branch
- `<commit-sha>`: Specific commit
- `<branch-name>`: Branch-specific builds

## Next Steps

1. **Verify secrets are set** in repository settings
2. **Test the pipeline** by pushing a commit
3. **Monitor first build** in GitHub Actions
4. **Deploy manually** when ready
5. **Set up branch protection rules** to require tests before merge

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails:
- Check test outputs
- Verify Dockerfiles are correct
- Review GitHub Actions logs

### Deploy fails:
- Verify SSH secrets
- Check server Docker installation
- Ensure server has GHCR access

### Security warnings:
- Review vulnerable dependencies
- Update npm packages
- Run `npm audit fix`

## Benefits

✅ **Faster deployments**: Pre-built images
✅ **Better versioning**: Commit SHA tags
✅ **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
✅ **Quality**: Automated testing on every change
✅ **Reliability**: Health checks after deployment
